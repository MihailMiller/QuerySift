Image processing involves the manipulation and analysis of digital images.

### Techniques in Image Processing
1. **Image Enhancement**: Adjusting contrast and brightness for better visibility.
2. **Edge Detection**: Identifying object boundaries in an image.
3. **Segmentation**: Dividing an image into meaningful parts.

### Role of Deep Learning in Image Processing
Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have revolutionized image recognition by enabling:

- **Facial Recognition**: Security systems use CNNs for identity verification.
- **Medical Imaging**: AI-assisted analysis of X-rays and MRI scans.
- **Object Detection**: Used in traffic surveillance and autonomous driving.

### Practical Use Cases
- **Self-Driving Cars**: Detect pedestrians and traffic signals using image processing.
- **Augmented Reality (AR)**: Enhances real-world interactions with digital elements.
