# QuerySift: Multi-Document Question Answering

## Overview

If you have a collection of documents on a specific topic and a set of unanswered questions, this tool helps you quickly skim through the material, extract key information, and provide an entry point for deeper research.

### What It Can Do:

- ‚úÖ **Provide an overview of the material** (useful for learning, research, interviews, etc.)
- ‚úÖ **Extract answers** from multiple documents based on predefined questions
- ‚úÖ **Highlight key information** in text files automatically
- ‚úÖ **Generate structured reports** in Excel and Word for easy review

### What It Cannot Do:

- ‚ùå **Replace human judgment** ‚Äì This tool is purely extractive, meaning it retrieves relevant excerpts but does not create new content or provide deep contextual understanding. Final review and interpretation are up to the user.

## How It Works

1Ô∏è‚É£ **Loads Questions:** Reads predefined questions from a JSON file.

2Ô∏è‚É£ **Splits Large Texts:** Breaks down big text files into smaller pieces.

3Ô∏è‚É£ **Finds Relevant Matches:** Uses AI to compare text pieces with the questions.

4Ô∏è‚É£ **Highlights Important Text:** Automatically marks key phrases.

5Ô∏è‚É£ **Removes Duplicates:** Keeps only the best and most relevant matches.

6Ô∏è‚É£ **Saves to Excel & Word:** Organizes results neatly for easy access.

## What You Need Before Running

1Ô∏è‚É£ **Text Files:** Put them in a folder called `texts/`

2Ô∏è‚É£ **Predefined Questions:** Ensure `category_questions.json` is a structured JSON file containing predefined questions categorized by topics of interest. It should be formatted as follows:

```json
{
  "Technology": {
    "Artificial Intelligence": {
      "Deep Learning": ["What are the applications of AI?", "How does deep learning improve AI?"],
      "Machine Learning": ["What are the different types of machine learning?", "How does supervised learning work?"]
    },
    "Natural Language Processing": {
      "Text Analysis": ["What are the key challenges in NLP?", "How does sentiment analysis work?"],
      "Speech Recognition": ["How do voice assistants work?", "What is the role of transformers in NLP?"]
    },
    "Computer Vision": {
      "Image Processing": ["What are the applications of computer vision?", "How do convolutional neural networks (CNNs) work?"],
      "Object Detection": ["How does YOLO work?", "What are the latest advancements in object detection?"]
    }
  }
}
```

## üõ†Ô∏è Installation & Setup

1Ô∏è‚É£ Install the required Python libraries by running:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy torch transformers scikit-learn tqdm python-docx openpyxl einops
```

2Ô∏è‚É£ Run the script using:

```bash
python querysift.py
```

You can also customize the settings using command-line arguments (see below üëá).

## ‚öôÔ∏è Customization Options (Command-Line Arguments)

You can tweak how the script works by using these options:

| Option                    | Default Value                       | What It Does                                |
| ------------------------- | ----------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| `--chunk_size`            | `1000`                              | How big each text chunk should be           |
| `--chunk_overlap`         | `500`                               | How much overlap each chunk should have     |
| `--highlight_limit`       | `5`                                 | How many key phrases should be highlighted? |
| `--top_results_limit`     | `50`                                | How many excerpts should be retrieved?      |
| `--minimum_merge_overlap` | `10`                                | Minimum words required to merge chunks      |
| `--embedding_model`       | `jinaai/jina-embeddings-v3`         | AI model used to find similar texts         |
| `--qa_model`              | `deepset/gelectra-large-germanquad` | AI model used for key phrases               |
