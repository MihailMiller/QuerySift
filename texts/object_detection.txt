Object detection is a computer vision technique that identifies and localizes objects in images and videos.

### Popular Object Detection Models
1. **YOLO (You Only Look Once)**: Real-time object detection with high speed.
2. **Faster R-CNN**: Balances accuracy and computational efficiency.
3. **SSD (Single Shot Detector)**: Detects objects at multiple scales.

### Challenges in Object Detection
- **Occlusion**: Objects blocking each other reduce detection accuracy.
- **Lighting Conditions**: Poor lighting affects detection reliability.
- **Scale Variability**: Detecting small objects in high-resolution images.

### Applications of Object Detection
- **Autonomous Vehicles**: Detecting pedestrians, cars, and traffic signs.
- **Security Surveillance**: Identifying intruders in restricted areas.
- **Retail Checkout Automation**: Amazon Go stores use object detection for automated payments.
