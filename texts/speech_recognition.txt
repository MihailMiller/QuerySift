Speech recognition converts spoken language into text and is a key component of voice-enabled systems.

### Evolution of Speech Recognition
- Early systems in the 1950s could recognize only digits.
- In the 1990s, Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) improved recognition accuracy.
- Deep learning, particularly Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) and Transformers, have made modern speech recognition highly accurate.

### Key Challenges
- **Accent Variability**: Different accents can cause recognition errors.
- **Background Noise**: Loud environments affect speech-to-text accuracy.
- **Homophones**: Words like "two" and "too" sound identical but have different meanings.

### Real-World Applications
- **Virtual Assistants**: Siri, Google Assistant, and Alexa rely on speech recognition.
- **Transcription Services**: AI is used to generate subtitles for movies and lectures.
- **Voice-Controlled Devices**: Smart home automation with voice commands.
