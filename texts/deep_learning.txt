Deep learning is a subset of machine learning that is based on artificial neural networks. 
It enables computers to process data in a way that mimics human brain functionality. 
Deep learning models have revolutionized multiple fields, including computer vision, natural language processing, and healthcare.

### History of Deep Learning
The origins of deep learning can be traced back to the 1940s with early work on neural networks. 
However, significant breakthroughs happened in the 1980s with backpropagation and in the 2010s with the advent of large-scale datasets and increased computational power.

### Key Architectures
1. **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)**: Used extensively for image recognition and processing tasks.
2. **Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)**: Applied in time-series data and natural language processing.
3. **Transformers**: Revolutionized NLP with models like BERT and GPT.

### Real-World Applications
- **Autonomous Vehicles**: Deep learning is the core of computer vision models used in self-driving cars.
- **Medical Diagnosis**: AI-powered deep learning models assist in detecting diseases like cancer from medical images.
- **Voice Assistants**: Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant use deep learning for speech recognition.
