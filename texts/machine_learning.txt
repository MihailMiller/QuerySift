Machine learning (ML) is an artificial intelligence technique that enables computers to learn patterns from data without explicit programming.

### Types of Machine Learning
1. **Supervised Learning**: Uses labeled data to make predictions. Examples include regression and classification models.
2. **Unsupervised Learning**: Identifies hidden patterns in data without labeled outputs (e.g., clustering and association).
3. **Reinforcement Learning**: Uses an agent to learn optimal actions by maximizing rewards (e.g., AlphaGo).

### Key Algorithms
- **Decision Trees**: Hierarchical structures for classification and regression.
- **Support Vector Machines (SVMs)**: Used for classification problems with high-dimensional data.
- **Neural Networks**: Inspired by the human brain and used for deep learning applications.

### Real-World Use Cases
- **Fraud Detection**: Banks use ML to detect unusual transactions and prevent fraud.
- **Recommendation Systems**: Netflix and YouTube use ML to personalize content recommendations.
- **Healthcare**: ML aids in predicting patient diagnoses based on historical data.
